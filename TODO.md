2. Create new Data model for the database

3. Make a simple UI


-------

1. Create a Python script that gets Telegram Messages

2. Create a Python script that waits for NEW Telegram Messages and sends them to the PHP. PHP then creates an event. React is subsribed to this event 

3. Make it so that URL is a primary key in the database. So that when we reload the table saved messages of users will be okay
